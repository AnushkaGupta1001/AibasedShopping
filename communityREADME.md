## 🌟 Why This Project Is Innovative

This project bridges **beauty-tech and immersive UX**, solving a real-world challenge in the skincare industry: *decision fatigue*. With thousands of options and confusing ingredient lists, users often rely on trial-and-error or influencer hype — instead of informed decisions.

🔍 This prototype:
- Simulates **AI-like product guidance** through logic-driven form flows
- Offers a **low-friction, intuitive UX** — especially for users new to skincare
- Is built to evolve into an **AR/VR or AI-powered recommendation engine** in the future
- Introduces **personalisation and interactivity** without the need for backend infrastructure — making it scalable for small beauty brands too

This is a stepping stone towards more **intelligent, immersive shopping experiences** in beauty ecommerce — and a proof-of-concept for **ethical AI implementation in consumer tech**.
